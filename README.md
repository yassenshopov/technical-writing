# Arrow Functions in JavaScript

- If you have been programming for a while, you must be aware of the concept of __functions__ so far.

```

function y(x) {
  return 2 * x;
}

```

- Since functions are so widely and commonly used, wouuldn't it be great if there was a way to make them shorter and more concise?
- Say "hi" to Arrow Functions


```

let y = (x) => y = 2*x;

```
