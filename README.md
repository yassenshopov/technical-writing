# Arrow Functions in JavaScript

- If you have been programming for a while, you must be aware of the concept of __functions__ so far.
- Since functions are so widely and commonly used, wouuldn't it be great if there was a way to make them shorter and more concise?

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
