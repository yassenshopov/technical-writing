# Arrow Functions in JavaScript

If you have been programming for a while, you must be aware of the concept of __functions__. 
 
Functions can be defined as pieces of code that are designed to do one particular task. If you need this task to be done multiple times throughout your code, you can put it in a function and just call the function every time you need it, instead of repeatedly writing long pieces of code.

Let's say you want a function to calculate the square of whatever number you put as input. Typically, in JavaScript, a function looks like this:

```

function square(x) {
  return x ** 2;
}

```

Then you can just call your function inside your code anytime you need it, just like I did here

Since functions are so widely and commonly used, wouldn't it be great if there was a way to make them shorter and more concise? Thankfully, developers have been working hard on that front, and ever since ES6 (a newer version of JavaScript, released in 2015), there is now a way to write __shorter__ and __cleaner__ functions that do the same job as regular ones.

Say "hello" to Arrow Functions.


```

let square = (x) => square = x**2;

```

As you can see from just a glance, arrow functions look very similar to regular functions, but they are also much more straightforward, especially for basic calculations and operations. They are most commonly used for one-line operations.

In this article, we will go over the syntax of arrow functions, how they are different from regular functions, and their use of the *'this'* keyword.

---

## Syntax

As we already mentioned, the syntax of an arrow function resembles that of a normal function. It still consists of an output, input (arguments), and the expression that transforms the input into an output.

While regular functions have a single, set-in-stone syntax, arrow functions can look different to each other depending on the number of lines they take and the number of arguments they take as inputs.

We will start off with the most simple iteration - an arrow function which takes no arguments.

1. No arguments

```

let x = 5;
let y = 3;
() => x**y; // output will always be equal to 125

```

This type of function takes no inputs, and just uses previously declared variables for its calculations/operations. You can compare it with a traditional function that also takes no arguments, also known as an "anonymous function"":

```

let x = 5;
let y = 3;
function power() {
  return x ** y;
}
z = power(x,y) // z will be equal to 125

```

2. Single argument

In this case, parentheses are still optional, and an arrow function with a single parameter as input will look like this:

```

let y = (x) => y = 3*x;

//The following code works the same way:

let y = x => y = 3*x;

```

3. Several arguments

Now, when more than one input argument is taken, parantheses become compulsory, like this:

```

let z = (x,y) => z = 3*x + y;

```

Arrow functions can furthed be differentiated by the number of expressions they have in their statement body.

1. Single-expression arrow functions

For a simple enough parametric calculation, the following syntax will be plenty, and will keep the arrow function short and concise (and most importantly *functioning*):

```

let output = (a,b) => output = a*b;

```

As you can see, it is a single line, and thus, no curly brackets are needed. The situation changes however when we get to...

2. Multiple-expressions arrow functions 

This is the situation at which you want your arrow function to do a bit more than just one calculation. In that case, you need to add curly brackets for your expression, which makes it resemble a regular function in terms of syntax. But then again, if you want to make a long and complex function, arrow functions may not be the first thing to come to your mind anyway.

```
let output = (a,b) => {
  let temporary_output = a + b;
  return output = temporary_output/2;
};

```

We shouldn't forget to trat the expression in the curly brackets as a normal function and declare our variables and use the *'return'* keyword when it gets to the output.

## Usage of const/let

With the introduction of the new standard for writing JavaScript in 2015, ES6, many new features were introduce, including arrow functions. The other important bit is the new variable name *'let'*, which allows us to scope a variable in the frame of just one block, instead of using it throughout the whole function. With *'var'*, the variable would have to be declared throughout the whole function, and *'let'* allows for more precise and fine control over the process.

Since *'let'* was introduced together with arrow function, it makes sense that arrow functions cannot be used with *'var'*, and are instead used either with *'let'* or *'const'*. *'const'* is used when the variable is immutable (its value isn't allowed to change after the initial declaration) and *'let'* is used when the variable can change its value throughout the code.

The arrow function itself needs to be declared first, since it doesn't possess the *'function'* keyword, and thus the use of *let/const* is to be expected.

## Arrow Functions VS Regular Functions

Arrow functions are different from regular functions not only in the visual sense.

For example, arrow functions have a different behaviour when it comes to objects and object generation, which are crucial concepts in OOP. Arrow functions:

- Cannot be used as function constructors. If you try to use the *'new'* keyword, you will get an error:

```

let y = (x) => const object = new Object(); //error

```

- The keyword *'function'* is absent from the syntax of the arrow function. The arrow ('=>') itself hints at the use of a function, so repetition would be redundant.

- The keyword *'return'* is also absent from the statment bit, as it is enough to just write the statement(s).  

## Arrow Functions as Object Literals

Arrow functions have a different behviour than regular functions when it comes to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). Arrow functions are generally preferred for parametric calculations, but not so much when it comes to creating constructors and working with classes. 

The main difference when it comes to object behaviour is the usage of *'this'*.

## What does "this" reference to?

You may have seen the keyword *'this'* pop up occasionally in tutorials and example codes. And just like many other programming concepts, it is very context-dependent.

*'this'* is handled differently depending on the type of function that calls for it. In the case of regular functions, the keyword *'this'* represents the object called by the function. As you can see in the following example, when a button function calls for *'this'*, *'this'* represents the buttons, and the properties of *'this'* are the properties of the button. 

With regular functions, '*this'* could be anything - the body of the HTML DOM, the event-triggering element, or just the window itself.

With arrow functions, the situation is a little bit different.

While *'this'* in regular functions applies to the object that __calls__ the function, when *'this'* is used by arrow functions, *'this'* represents the object that is owning the arrow function. In JavaScript, since it is running on the browser's console, the owner will generally be the window.
